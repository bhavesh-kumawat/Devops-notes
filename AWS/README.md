1. What is AWS and what are its core services?
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.
• Offers on-demand computing, storage, networking, databases, and other services over the internet.
• Provides scalable, secure, and cost-efficient infrastructure for building applications without managing physical hardware.
• Follows a pay-as-you-go model.

3. What is AWS Regions vs Availability Zones?
FeatureAWS RegionAvailability Zone (AZ)DefinitionA geographical area containing multiple data centersA physically separate data center within a regionPurposeProvides global reach and geographical separationProvides fault isolation and high availability within a regionRedundancyRegions are completely independentAZs in the same region are isolated but connected via low-latency linksUse CaseMulti-region deployment for disaster recovery or latency optimizationHigh availability architecture (e.g., multi-AZ EC2 or RDS)Number per AWS Account~30+ globallyMultiple per region (usually 2–6)DistanceHundreds to thousands of kilometers apartTypically <100 km apart for low latency
4. What is Auto Scaling and how does it work?
Auto Scaling is an AWS service that automatically adjusts the number of compute resources (EC2 instances, containers) based on demand.
• Ensures applications have the right capacity at all times
• Helps improve availability, reduce costs, and handle traffic spikes
🔹 Key Components
1. Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
    ◦ Logical group of instances managed together
    ◦ Defines min, max, and desired instance count
2. Launch Template / Launch Configuration
    ◦ Defines instance type, AMI, key pairs, security groups
3. Scaling Policies
    ◦ Dynamic scaling → reacts to metrics (CPU, memory, custom CloudWatch metrics)
    ◦ Scheduled scaling → scales at specific times (e.g., daily traffic peak)
    ◦ Target tracking → maintains a metric at a target value
4. Health Checks
    ◦ Ensures unhealthy instances are terminated and replaced
🔹 How Auto Scaling Works
1. Define an Auto Scaling Group
    ◦ Select AMI, instance type, network settings, min/max/desired size
2. Set Scaling Policies
    ◦ Example: scale out if average CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
    ◦ Example: scale in if CPU < 30% for 10 minutes
3. Monitor Metrics
    ◦ CloudWatch tracks metrics (CPU, memory, custom metrics)
4. Trigger Scaling Action
    ◦ If thresholds are breached, Auto Scaling adds or removes instances
    ◦ Health checks replace unhealthy instances automatically
🔹 Example Use Case
• Web application serving traffic spikes:
    ◦ Min instances: 2
    ◦ Max instances: 10
    ◦ Target CPU: 50%
• Auto Scaling will automatically launch new instances when CPU rises above 50% and terminate them when it drops below 50%

9. How do you make an application highly available on AWS?
🔹 Definition of High Availability
High Availability means designing your application so that it remains operational and accessible even if some components fail, minimizing downtime.
🔹 Steps to Make an Application Highly Available on AWS
1️⃣ Use Multiple Availability Zones (AZs)
• Deploy EC2 instances, databases, and load balancers across multiple AZs
• AZs are isolated data centers within a region
• If one AZ fails, traffic can route to healthy AZs
Example:
• Web servers in 2 AZs behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
2️⃣ Use Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)
• Distribute traffic across multiple instances/AZs
• Supports health checks → automatically route traffic away from unhealthy instances
3️⃣ Use Auto Scaling
• Automatically increase or decrease EC2 instances based on demand
• Ensures enough capacity during traffic spikes and cost efficiency when idle
4️⃣ Deploy Multi-AZ or Multi-Region Databases
• RDS Multi-AZ → automated failover if primary DB fails
• Aurora Global DB / DynamoDB Global Tables → multi-region redundancy
• Ensures data is highly available and durable
5️⃣ Use Fault-Tolerant Storage
• S3 → stores objects redundantly across multiple AZs
• EFS → highly available network file system
• Avoid single points of failure for critical data
6️⃣ Decouple Components
• Use SQS, SNS, or EventBridge for asynchronous messaging
• Decoupling reduces dependency on single component failure
7️⃣ Implement Health Checks & Monitoring
• Use CloudWatch metrics and alarms for:
    ◦ EC2 instance health
    ◦ Load balancer metrics
    ◦ Database availability
• Integrate with Auto Scaling / Lambda for automated recovery
8️⃣ Use DNS Failover for Multi-Region HA
• Route 53 can detect region failure and route traffic to another healthy region
• Ensures disaster recovery across regions
9️⃣ Backup & Disaster Recovery
• Regular backups of databases and S3 data
• Test failover procedures regularly
10. How do you secure data at rest and in transit?

15. How do you implement CI/CD for a multi-region deployment?
🔹 Goal
Implement a CI/CD pipeline that deploys applications across multiple AWS regions while ensuring:
• High availability
• Zero or minimal downtime
• Consistency across regions
• Rollback capability
🔹 Step 1: Use a CI/CD Tool
• Use AWS native tools (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy) or third-party tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
• Define stages: Build → Test → Deploy.
🔹 Step 2: Build & Test Once
• Build the application once in a primary region.
• Produce immutable artifacts (Docker images, JAR/WAR, Lambda packages).
• Run unit/integration tests to ensure reliability.
Tip: Use S3 or ECR to store artifacts accessible from all regions.
🔹 Step 3: Multi-Region Deployment Strategy
Option 1: Blue/Green Deployment per Region
• Deploy new version to green environment in each region.
• Route traffic using Route 53 weighted or failover routing.
• Switch traffic gradually from blue → green after validation.
Option 2: Canary Deployment
• Deploy new version to small subset of servers in each region.
• Monitor metrics (latency, errors) via CloudWatch/Grafana.
• Gradually increase deployment scope.
Option 3: Rolling Deployment
• Deploy new version in batches per region.
• Use Auto Scaling Groups or Kubernetes rolling updates.
🔹 Step 4: Traffic Management
• Use Route 53 DNS routing policies:
    ◦ Weighted routing → shift traffic gradually
    ◦ Failover routing → send traffic to healthy region if primary fails
• Optionally use CloudFront for global distribution of static content
🔹 Step 5: Monitoring & Rollback
• Monitor application metrics: latency, errors, CPU/memory
• Set CloudWatch alarms integrated with CodeDeploy or Lambda for automatic rollback
• Keep artifact versions immutable for rollback per region
🔹 Step 6: Automation
• Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like CloudFormation, Terraform, or CDK to deploy infrastructure consistently across regions
• Automate secrets provisioning using Secrets Manager / Parameter Store
16. How do you troubleshoot performance issues in AWS?
🔹 Step 1: Identify the Symptoms
• High latency, slow application response, timeouts, or failed requests
• Use CloudWatch metrics to detect spikes in CPU, memory, or network utilization
Key AWS Metrics to Check:
• EC2: CPUUtilization, NetworkIn/Out, DiskReadOps/WriteOps
• RDS / Aurora: CPU, Connections, Read/Write Latency, FreeStorageSpace
• ELB / ALB: Latency, 4xx/5xx errors, RequestCount
• S3 / DynamoDB: Throttled requests, latency
🔹 Step 2: Analyze Application Logs
• Check CloudWatch Logs or application logs
• Look for errors, exceptions, or slow queries
• Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query and filter logs efficiently
🔹 Step 3: Check Resource Utilization
• EC2 / ECS / EKS: Are instances under-provisioned?
• Auto Scaling: Are scaling policies insufficient or delayed?
• RDS / DynamoDB: High IOPS, CPU, or throttling
• S3: Request rate limits or eventual consistency issues
🔹 Step 4: Network Performance
• Check VPC Flow Logs for connectivity issues
• Check latency and throughput for ELB, NLB, or API Gateway
• Ensure subnet, route tables, and security groups are configured properly
🔹 Step 5: Database & Storage Bottlenecks
• RDS / Aurora: Slow queries, missing indexes, insufficient instance type
• DynamoDB: Provisioned throughput limits, hot partitions
• S3 / EFS: High latency in reads/writes, consider caching with CloudFront or ElastiCache
🔹 Step 6: Application & Code Level
• Identify CPU/memory-intensive operations or inefficient code
• Check thread pools, connection pools, or queue backlogs
• Profile using X-Ray for distributed tracing
🔹 Step 7: Scaling & Optimization
• Use Auto Scaling Groups or ECS/EKS Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
• Optimize instance types or storage performance
• Consider caching (ElastiCache, CloudFront) to reduce load on DB
🔹 Step 8: Monitor & Alert
• Set CloudWatch alarms for CPU, memory, latency, error rates
• Use Grafana or CloudWatch Dashboards for visualization
• Integrate with SNS for notifications
🔹 Step 9: Document & Prevent
• Identify root cause
• Update runbooks / automated remediation
• Optimize architecture for future growth
⚙️ Scenario-Based / DevOps-Focused
17. Your EC2 instance is unreachable, how do you debug?
🔹 Step 1: Check Security Groups
• Verify inbound rules allow traffic on the port you are trying to reach (e.g., 22 for SSH, 3389 for RDP)
• Verify source IP ranges in the rules
• Confirm outbound rules allow responses
🔹 Step 2: Check Network ACLs (NACLs)
• Ensure the subnet-level NACLs allow inbound and outbound traffic for the relevant ports
• Remember NACLs are stateless, so both inbound and outbound rules must permit traffic
🔹 Step 3: Verify the Route Table
• Ensure the subnet has a route to the Internet Gateway if it’s a public instance
• For private instances, ensure NAT Gateway or VPC peering is correctly configured
🔹 Step 4: Check the Instance State
• Confirm the EC2 instance is running
• Check the system status checks and instance status checks in the EC2 console
• If a status check failed, AWS might provide recommended actions
🔹 Step 5: Use Session Manager (SSM)
• If the instance has SSM agent installed and IAM role attached, use Session Manager to access it without SSH
• Helps debug network, firewall, or service issues
🔹 Step 6: Verify Key Pair / Credentials
• For SSH, ensure you’re using the correct private key
• Verify user name (e.g., ec2-user for Amazon Linux, ubuntu for Ubuntu)
• Check permissions of private key (chmod 400 key.pem)
🔹 Step 7: Check Operating System
• Once accessed (via SSM or serial console):
    ◦ Check firewall (iptables / ufw) rules
    ◦ Ensure the SSH or RDP service is running
    ◦ Check system logs (/var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog)
🔹 Step 8: Check Elastic IP / Public IP
• Ensure the instance has a public IP if connecting over the Internet
• Check Elastic IP association
• For private instances, confirm access via VPN, Direct Connect, or Bastion host
🔹 Step 9: Use AWS Tools
• VPC Reachability Analyzer → check connectivity between your source and EC2
• CloudTrail / CloudWatch Logs → detect events affecting instance connectivity
🔹 Step 10: Reboot / Replace (if necessary)
• If nothing works, try rebooting the instance
• If the root volume is corrupted, consider launching a new instance and attaching the old volume for investigation
18. S3 bucket is not accessible by your app — what could be wrong?
🔹 Possible Reasons Why an S3 Bucket Is Not Accessible
1️⃣ IAM Permissions
• The role or user your application uses may lack proper permissions.
• Ensure the IAM policy allows s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject, or other required actions for the bucket.
• Check if there are explicit deny statements overriding allow permissions.
2️⃣ Bucket Policy
• The bucket may have a policy restricting access to certain IAM users, roles, or IPs.
• Verify that the bucket policy allows the requesting principal to perform the required actions.
3️⃣ Public Access Settings
• S3 Block Public Access might prevent access even if the bucket policy allows it.
• Check Account-level and bucket-level block public access settings.
4️⃣ VPC Endpoint / Private Bucket
• If the bucket is private and accessed from a VPC, you may need an S3 VPC endpoint.
• Ensure the endpoint policy allows your app to reach the bucket.
5️⃣ CORS Configuration (for web apps)
• For browser-based apps, the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules may prevent access.
• Verify allowed origins, headers, and methods in the bucket CORS configuration.
6️⃣ Object-Level Permissions
• Even if the bucket is accessible, individual objects may have restrictive ACLs.
• Check object ownership and ACLs.
7️⃣ Networking / Connectivity Issues
• If accessing from a private subnet without internet or S3 endpoint, the app may not reach S3.
• Ensure proper route tables, NAT Gateway, or VPC endpoints are configured.
8️⃣ Region Mismatch
• Accessing the bucket in the wrong AWS region may cause errors.
• Confirm your app is using the correct region endpoint.
9️⃣ KMS Encryption
• If the bucket or objects are encrypted with KMS, the IAM role must have kms:Decrypt permission.
🔹 How to Troubleshoot Step by Step
1. Check IAM role/user permissions (s3:GetObject, s3:ListBucket)
2. Check bucket policy for explicit denies or IP restrictions
3. Check public access block settings
4. Check networking (VPC endpoints, NAT, routing)
5. Verify region and bucket name in the app config
6. If using KMS encryption, ensure proper key permissions
19. How do you migrate an on-prem application to AWS?
🔹 Step 1: Assessment & Planning
1. Inventory your application
    ◦ List servers, databases, storage, networking, and dependencies
2. Classify workloads
    ◦ Tier applications: critical, non-critical, low/high complexity
3. Define goals
    ◦ Cost optimization, scalability, high availability, disaster recovery
4. Select migration approach
    ◦ Rehost (“lift and shift”) → move as-is to EC2
    ◦ Replatform (“lift, tinker, and shift”) → minimal changes, e.g., migrate database to RDS
    ◦ Refactor / Re-architect → redesign for cloud-native (microservices, serverless)
🔹 Step 2: Choose AWS Services
• Compute: EC2, ECS, EKS, Lambda
• Storage: S3, EBS, EFS
• Databases: RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB
• Networking: VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, Route 53
• Monitoring: CloudWatch, X-Ray
🔹 Step 3: Prepare the Environment
1. Networking
    ◦ Design VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, route tables, security groups
2. Identity & Access
    ◦ Configure IAM roles and policies
3. Logging & Monitoring
    ◦ Enable CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and alarms
🔹 Step 4: Migration Execution
Option A: Lift-and-Shift
• Use AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) or VM Import/Export
• Move VMs to EC2 with minimal changes
Option B: Database Migration
• Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
• Supports homogeneous (MySQL → MySQL) or heterogeneous (Oracle → Aurora) migrations
• Enable ongoing replication to minimize downtime
Option C: Application Refactoring
• Break monolith into microservices on ECS/EKS
• Migrate static content to S3 + CloudFront
• Consider Lambda / Step Functions for serverless workflows
🔹 Step 5: Testing
• Validate functionality, performance, and security
• Run load tests to compare with on-prem performance
• Ensure data consistency after migration
🔹 Step 6: Cutover & Optimization
• Switch production traffic to AWS
• Decommission on-prem resources
• Optimize for cost, scalability, and HA
• Use Auto Scaling, ELB, CloudFront, and caching for performance
🔹 Step 7: Monitoring & Ongoing Management
• Use CloudWatch, X-Ray, and AWS Config for ongoing monitoring
• Set up alerts, dashboards, and automated remediation
20. Your Lambda function is timing out — what do you do?
🔹 Step 1: Check the Timeout Setting
• Each Lambda has a configured timeout (default: 3 seconds, max: 15 minutes).
• If the function is long-running, increase the timeout in the Lambda console, CLI, or IaC template.
🔹 Step 2: Analyze CloudWatch Logs
• Lambda automatically logs start, end, and errors in CloudWatch Logs.
• Look for:
    ◦ Long-running loops
    ◦ External API calls timing out
    ◦ Resource access errors (DB, S3, DynamoDB)
🔹 Step 3: Check Resource Limits
• Memory allocation affects CPU in Lambda → low memory can cause slow execution.
• Consider increasing memory; it often improves performance as CPU scales with memory.
🔹 Step 4: Inspect External Dependencies
• Common causes of timeout:
    ◦ Slow database queries (RDS, DynamoDB)
    ◦ Long HTTP requests / third-party APIs
    ◦ Network issues in VPC (private subnets without NAT)
Tip: If Lambda is in a VPC, ensure it has NAT Gateway or VPC endpoints to access external services.
🔹 Step 5: Optimize Code & Logic
• Look for inefficient loops, heavy computations, or blocking calls.
• Consider parallel processing or batch processing to reduce execution time.
• For long tasks, consider breaking the function into smaller Lambdas or using Step Functions for orchestration.
🔹 Step 6: Use Retries & Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)
• Lambda automatically retries on errors (if configured).
• Configure DLQ (SNS or SQS) to capture failed events for debugging and reprocessing.
🔹 Step 7: Monitor Metrics
• Use CloudWatch Lambda metrics:
    ◦ Duration → actual execution time
    ◦ Timeouts → number of timeouts
    ◦ Errors → failed invocations
• This helps identify trends and patterns causing timeouts.
21. How do you implement blue-green deployment in AWS?
🔹 What is Blue-Green Deployment?
Blue-Green Deployment is a strategy where you have two identical environments:
• Blue environment: currently serving production traffic
• Green environment: new version of the application to deploy
Traffic is switched from blue → green once the new version is tested and validated, reducing downtime and rollback risk.
🔹 Step 1: Prepare Environments
1. Provision two identical environments using AWS services:
    ◦ EC2 / Auto Scaling Groups, or
    ◦ ECS / EKS services, or
    ◦ Elastic Beanstalk environments
2. Ensure both environments are ready to handle full production traffic.
🔹 Step 2: Deploy to Green Environment
• Deploy the new version to the green environment
• Run smoke tests to validate the deployment
• Monitor CloudWatch metrics for errors, latency, or failures
🔹 Step 3: Switch Traffic
• Use AWS Route 53 for DNS-based traffic switching:
    ◦ Weighted routing → gradually shift traffic from blue to green
    ◦ Failover routing → route traffic to green if blue fails
• If using Elastic Load Balancers (ALB/NLB):
    ◦ Update target groups to point to green environment
🔹 Step 4: Monitor & Validate
• Monitor application and metrics:
    ◦ CPU, memory, request latency, error rates
• Confirm everything is working before decommissioning blue environment
🔹 Step 5: Rollback Plan
• Keep the blue environment intact until green is fully validated
• If issues occur, switch traffic back to blue immediately
🔹 AWS Tools for Blue-Green DeploymentAWS ServiceHow it HelpsElastic BeanstalkSupports Blue/Green environment swaps out of the boxCodeDeployAutomates blue-green deployment to EC2, ECS, or LambdaRoute 53DNS-based traffic switching between environmentsALB / NLBTarget group switching for traffic routingCloudWatchMonitor metrics and health during deployment
🔹 Example Scenario
• Deploy a new web application version:
    1. Current version on Blue (prod)
    2. New version deployed on Green (staging)
    3. Test green environment
    4. Switch Route 53 weighted traffic: 10% → 50% → 100% to green
    5. Monitor metrics → if stable, terminate blue
22. How would you set up monitoring and alerting for a production web app?
🔹 Step 1: Identify What to Monitor
For a production web app, monitor three main layers:
1. Infrastructure
    ◦ CPU, memory, disk, network of EC2 instances or containers
    ◦ Database health (RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora)
    ◦ Load balancer metrics (ALB/NLB)
2. Application
    ◦ Request latency and throughput
    ◦ Error rates (4xx/5xx responses)
    ◦ Application logs for exceptions
3. Business Metrics
    ◦ Transactions per second
    ◦ User logins or purchases
    ◦ Queue lengths (SQS, Kafka)
🔹 Step 2: Choose Monitoring Tools
AWS-Native Options:
• CloudWatch Metrics → infrastructure and service-level metrics
• CloudWatch Logs / Logs Insights → application and error logs
• X-Ray → distributed tracing for latency and bottlenecks
• CloudTrail → audit AWS API activity
Open-Source / Third-Party:
• Prometheus + Grafana → metrics collection and visualization
• ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) → log aggregation and analysis
🔹 Step 3: Set Up Dashboards
• CloudWatch or Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
• Combine metrics and logs in a single view:
    ◦ EC2 CPU / Memory vs Request Latency
    ◦ Database IOPS vs Application Errors
• Visualize trends over time to detect anomalies
🔹 Step 4: Define Alerts
• Set threshold-based alerts for critical metrics:
    ◦ CPU > 80% for 5 minutes
    ◦ Request error rate > 5%
    ◦ Latency > 2 seconds
• Configure CloudWatch Alarms / Prometheus Alerts
• Integrate with notification channels:
    ◦ SNS → Email, SMS, Slack
    ◦ PagerDuty or OpsGenie for on-call escalation
🔹 Step 5: Enable Logging & Tracing
• Application logs → CloudWatch Logs / ELK
• Structured logging → include request IDs and timestamps
• X-Ray → trace requests end-to-end for slow transactions
🔹 Step 6: Automate Remediation (Optional)
• Auto-scaling based on metrics (CPU, request latency)
• Lambda functions to restart failed services or notify teams
• Integrate alerts with incident management tools
🔹 Step 7: Test & Review
• Simulate failure scenarios (CPU spike, DB failure)
• Validate alert triggers and dashboard visibility
• Periodically review thresholds and alert rules
