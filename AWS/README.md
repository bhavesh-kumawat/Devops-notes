### 4. What is Auto Scaling and how does it work?

**Auto Scaling** is an AWS service that automatically adjusts the number of compute resources (EC2 instances, containers) based on demand.

- Ensures applications have the right capacity at all times
- Helps improve availability, reduce costs, and handle traffic spikes

#### 🔹 Key Components

**1. Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

- Logical group of instances managed together
- Defines min, max, and desired instance count

**2. Launch Template / Launch Configuration**

- Defines instance type, AMI, key pairs, security groups

**3. Scaling Policies**

- **Dynamic scaling** → reacts to metrics (CPU, memory, custom CloudWatch metrics)
- **Scheduled scaling** → scales at specific times (e.g., daily traffic peak)
- **Target tracking** → maintains a metric at a target value

**4. Health Checks**

- Ensures unhealthy instances are terminated and replaced

#### 🔹 How Auto Scaling Works

1. **Define an Auto Scaling Group**
    - Select AMI, instance type, network settings, min/max/desired size
2. **Set Scaling Policies**
    - Example: scale out if average CPU > 70% for 5 minutes
    - Example: scale in if CPU < 30% for 10 minutes
3. **Monitor Metrics**
    - CloudWatch tracks metrics (CPU, memory, custom metrics)
4. **Trigger Scaling Action**
    - If thresholds are breached, Auto Scaling adds or removes instances
    - Health checks replace unhealthy instances automatically

#### 🔹 Example Use Case

**Web application serving traffic spikes:**

- Min instances: 2
- Max instances: 10
- Target CPU: 50%

Auto Scaling will automatically launch new instances when CPU rises above 50% and terminate them when it drops below 50%.

#### 🔹 Steps to Make an Application Highly Available on AWS

**1️⃣ Use Multiple Availability Zones (AZs)**

- Deploy EC2 instances, databases, and load balancers across multiple AZs
- AZs are isolated data centers within a region
- If one AZ fails, traffic can route to healthy AZs
- Example: Web servers in 2 AZs behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

**2️⃣ Use Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)**

- Distribute traffic across multiple instances/AZs
- Supports health checks → automatically route traffic away from unhealthy instances

**3️⃣ Use Auto Scaling**

- Automatically increase or decrease EC2 instances based on demand
- Ensures enough capacity during traffic spikes and cost efficiency when idle

**4️⃣ Deploy Multi-AZ or Multi-Region Databases**

- **RDS Multi-AZ** → automated failover if primary DB fails
- **Aurora Global DB / DynamoDB Global Tables** → multi-region redundancy
- Ensures data is highly available and durable

**5️⃣ Use Fault-Tolerant Storage**

- **S3** → stores objects redundantly across multiple AZs
- **EFS** → highly available network file system
- Avoid single points of failure for critical data

**6️⃣ Decouple Components**

- Use SQS, SNS, or EventBridge for asynchronous messaging
- Decoupling reduces dependency on single component failure

**7️⃣ Implement Health Checks & Monitoring**

- Use CloudWatch metrics and alarms for:
    - EC2 instance health
    - Load balancer metrics
    - Database availability
- Integrate with Auto Scaling / Lambda for automated recovery

**8️⃣ Use DNS Failover for Multi-Region HA**

- Route 53 can detect region failure and route traffic to another healthy region
- Ensures disaster recovery across regions

**9️⃣ Backup & Disaster Recovery**

- Regular backups of databases and S3 data
- Test failover procedures regularly

## ⚙️ Scenario-Based / DevOps-Focused

### 17. Your EC2 instance is unreachable, how do you debug?

#### 🔹 Step 1: Check Security Groups

- Verify inbound rules allow traffic on the port you are trying to reach (e.g., 22 for SSH, 3389 for RDP)
- Verify source IP ranges in the rules
- Confirm outbound rules allow responses

#### 🔹 Step 2: Check Network ACLs (NACLs)

- Ensure the subnet-level NACLs allow inbound and outbound traffic for the relevant ports
- Remember NACLs are stateless, so both inbound and outbound rules must permit traffic

#### 🔹 Step 3: Verify the Route Table

- Ensure the subnet has a route to the Internet Gateway if it's a public instance
- For private instances, ensure NAT Gateway or VPC peering is correctly configured

#### 🔹 Step 4: Check the Instance State

- Confirm the EC2 instance is running
- Check the system status checks and instance status checks in the EC2 console
- If a status check failed, AWS might provide recommended actions

#### 🔹 Step 5: Use Session Manager (SSM)

- If the instance has SSM agent installed and IAM role attached, use Session Manager to access it without SSH
- Helps debug network, firewall, or service issues

#### 🔹 Step 6: Verify Key Pair / Credentials

- For SSH, ensure you're using the correct private key
- Verify user name (e.g., ec2-user for Amazon Linux, ubuntu for Ubuntu)
- Check permissions of private key (chmod 400 key.pem)

#### 🔹 Step 7: Check Operating System

Once accessed (via SSM or serial console):

- Check firewall (iptables / ufw) rules
- Ensure the SSH or RDP service is running
- Check system logs (/var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog)

#### 🔹 Step 8: Check Elastic IP / Public IP

- Ensure the instance has a public IP if connecting over the Internet
- Check Elastic IP association
- For private instances, confirm access via VPN, Direct Connect, or Bastion host

#### 🔹 Step 9: Use AWS Tools

- **VPC Reachability Analyzer** → check connectivity between your source and EC2
- **CloudTrail / CloudWatch Logs** → detect events affecting instance connectivity

#### 🔹 Step 10: Reboot / Replace (if necessary)

- If nothing works, try rebooting the instance
- If the root volume is corrupted, consider launching a new instance and attaching the old volume for investigation

---

### 18. S3 bucket is not accessible by your app — what could be wrong?

#### 🔹 Possible Reasons Why an S3 Bucket Is Not Accessible

**1️⃣ IAM Permissions**

- The role or user your application uses may lack proper permissions.
- Ensure the IAM policy allows s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject, or other required actions for the bucket.
- Check if there are explicit deny statements overriding allow permissions.

**2️⃣ Bucket Policy**

- The bucket may have a policy restricting access to certain IAM users, roles, or IPs.
- Verify that the bucket policy allows the requesting principal to perform the required actions.

**3️⃣ Public Access Settings**

- S3 Block Public Access might prevent access even if the bucket policy allows it.
- Check Account-level and bucket-level block public access settings.

**4️⃣ VPC Endpoint / Private Bucket**

- If the bucket is private and accessed from a VPC, you may need an S3 VPC endpoint.
- Ensure the endpoint policy allows your app to reach the bucket.

**5️⃣ CORS Configuration (for web apps)**

- For browser-based apps, the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules may prevent access.
- Verify allowed origins, headers, and methods in the bucket CORS configuration.

**6️⃣ Object-Level Permissions**

- Even if the bucket is accessible, individual objects may have restrictive ACLs.
- Check object ownership and ACLs.

**7️⃣ Networking / Connectivity Issues**

- If accessing from a private subnet without internet or S3 endpoint, the app may not reach S3.
- Ensure proper route tables, NAT Gateway, or VPC endpoints are configured.

**8️⃣ Region Mismatch**

- Accessing the bucket in the wrong AWS region may cause errors.
- Confirm your app is using the correct region endpoint.

**9️⃣ KMS Encryption**

- If the bucket or objects are encrypted with KMS, the IAM role must have kms:Decrypt permission.

#### 🔹 How to Troubleshoot Step by Step

1. Check IAM role/user permissions (s3:GetObject, s3:ListBucket)
2. Check bucket policy for explicit denies or IP restrictions
3. Check public access block settings
4. Check networking (VPC endpoints, NAT, routing)
5. Verify region and bucket name in the app config
6. If using KMS encryption, ensure proper key permissions

### 20. Your Lambda function is timing out — what do you do?

#### 🔹 Step 1: Check the Timeout Setting

- Each Lambda has a configured timeout (default: 3 seconds, max: 15 minutes).
- If the function is long-running, increase the timeout in the Lambda console, CLI, or IaC template.

#### 🔹 Step 2: Analyze CloudWatch Logs

- Lambda automatically logs start, end, and errors in CloudWatch Logs.
- Look for:
    - Long-running loops
    - External API calls timing out
    - Resource access errors (DB, S3, DynamoDB)

#### 🔹 Step 3: Check Resource Limits

- Memory allocation affects CPU in Lambda → low memory can cause slow execution.
- Consider increasing memory; it often improves performance as CPU scales with memory.

#### 🔹 Step 4: Inspect External Dependencies

Common causes of timeout:

- Slow database queries (RDS, DynamoDB)
- Long HTTP requests / third-party APIs
- Network issues in VPC (private subnets without NAT)

*Tip: If Lambda is in a VPC, ensure it has NAT Gateway or VPC endpoints to access external services.*

#### 🔹 Step 5: Optimize Code & Logic

- Look for inefficient loops, heavy computations, or blocking calls.
- Consider parallel processing or batch processing to reduce execution time.
- For long tasks, consider breaking the function into smaller Lambdas or using Step Functions for orchestration.

#### 🔹 Step 6: Use Retries & Dead Letter Queues (DLQ)

- Lambda automatically retries on errors (if configured).
- Configure DLQ (SNS or SQS) to capture failed events for debugging and reprocessing.

#### 🔹 Step 7: Monitor Metrics

Use CloudWatch Lambda metrics:

- **Duration** → actual execution time
- **Timeouts** → number of timeouts
- **Errors** → failed invocations

This helps identify trends and patterns causing timeouts.

### 21. How do you implement blue-green deployment in AWS?

#### 🔹 What is Blue-Green Deployment?

**Blue-Green Deployment** is a strategy where you have two identical environments:

- **Blue environment:** currently serving production traffic
- **Green environment:** new version of the application to deploy

Traffic is switched from blue → green once the new version is tested and validated, reducing downtime and rollback risk.

#### 🔹 Step 1: Prepare Environments

1. Provision two identical environments using AWS services:
    - EC2 / Auto Scaling Groups, or
    - ECS / EKS services, or
    - Elastic Beanstalk environments
2. Ensure both environments are ready to handle full production traffic.

#### 🔹 Step 2: Deploy to Green Environment

- Deploy the new version to the green environment
- Run smoke tests to validate the deployment
- Monitor CloudWatch metrics for errors, latency, or failures

#### 🔹 Step 3: Switch Traffic

- Use AWS **Route 53** for DNS-based traffic switching:
    - **Weighted routing** → gradually shift traffic from blue to green
    - **Failover routing** → route traffic to green if blue fails
- If using Elastic Load Balancers (ALB/NLB):
    - Update target groups to point to green environment

#### 🔹 Step 4: Monitor & Validate

- Monitor application and metrics:
    - CPU, memory, request latency, error rates
- Confirm everything is working before decommissioning blue environment

#### 🔹 Step 5: Rollback Plan

- Keep the blue environment intact until green is fully validated
- If issues occur, switch traffic back to blue immediately

#### 🔹 AWS Tools for Blue-Green Deployment

| **AWS Service** | **How it Helps** |
| --- | --- |
| Elastic Beanstalk | Supports Blue/Green environment swaps out of the box |
| CodeDeploy | Automates blue-green deployment to EC2, ECS, or Lambda |
| Route 53 | DNS-based traffic switching between environments |
| ALB / NLB | Target group switching for traffic routing |
| CloudWatch | Monitor metrics and health during deployment |

#### 🔹 Example Scenario

Deploy a new web application version:

1. Current version on Blue (prod)
2. New version deployed on Green (staging)
3. Test green environment
4. Switch Route 53 weighted traffic: 10% → 50% → 100% to green
5. Monitor metrics → if stable, terminate blue

### 22. How would you set up monitoring and alerting for a production web app?

#### 🔹 Step 1: Identify What to Monitor

For a production web app, monitor three main layers:

**1. Infrastructure**

- CPU, memory, disk, network of EC2 instances or containers
- Database health (RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora)
- Load balancer metrics (ALB/NLB)

**2. Application**

- Request latency and throughput
- Error rates (4xx/5xx responses)
- Application logs for exceptions

**3. Business Metrics**

- Transactions per second
- User logins or purchases
- Queue lengths (SQS, Kafka)

#### 🔹 Step 2: Choose Monitoring Tools

**AWS-Native Options:**

- **CloudWatch Metrics** → infrastructure and service-level metrics
- **CloudWatch Logs / Logs Insights** → application and error logs
- **X-Ray** → distributed tracing for latency and bottlenecks
- **CloudTrail** → audit AWS API activity

**Open-Source / Third-Party:**

- **Prometheus + Grafana** → metrics collection and visualization
- **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) → log aggregation and analysis

#### 🔹 Step 3: Set Up Dashboards

- CloudWatch or Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Combine metrics and logs in a single view:
    - EC2 CPU / Memory vs Request Latency
    - Database IOPS vs Application Errors
- Visualize trends over time to detect anomalies

#### 🔹 Step 4: Define Alerts

- Set threshold-based alerts for critical metrics:
    - CPU > 80% for 5 minutes
    - Request error rate > 5%
    - Latency > 2 seconds
- Configure CloudWatch Alarms / Prometheus Alerts
- Integrate with notification channels:
    - SNS → Email, SMS, Slack
    - PagerDuty or OpsGenie for on-call escalation

#### 🔹 Step 5: Enable Logging & Tracing

- **Application logs** → CloudWatch Logs / ELK
- **Structured logging** → include request IDs and timestamps
- **X-Ray** → trace requests end-to-end for slow transactions

#### 🔹 Step 6: Automate Remediation (Optional)

- Auto-scaling based on metrics (CPU, request latency)
- Lambda functions to restart failed services or notify teams
- Integrate alerts with incident management tools

#### 🔹 Step 7: Test & Review

- Simulate failure scenarios (CPU spike, DB failure)
- Validate alert triggers and dashboard visibility
- Periodically review thresholds and alert rules
