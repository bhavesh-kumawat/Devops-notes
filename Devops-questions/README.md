🔧 CI/CD & Automation
1. Your production deployment failed halfway through. What do you do?
🔹 Step 1: Stop the Bleeding (Stabilize First)
• Pause or abort the deployment pipeline immediately
• Prevent further changes from being rolled out
• Communicate in the incident channel: “Deployment paused, investigating”First goal is limit blast radius, not fix everything instantly.
🔹 Step 2: Assess Impact
Ask:
• Is the app partially serving traffic?
• Are users affected or just some instances?
• Which components are broken? (API, DB, background jobs)
Check:
• Load balancer health checks
• Error rates (4xx/5xx)
• Key business metrics
🔹 Step 3: Rollback or Fail Forward
Option A: Rollback (Most Common)
• Roll back to last known good version
• Examples:
    ◦ Blue-Green → switch traffic back to blue
    ◦ Kubernetes → kubectl rollout undo
    ◦ ECS → revert task definition
    ◦ Lambda → rollback to previous version/aliasRollback should be fast, automated, and boring
Option B: Fix Forward (If Safe & Small)
• Only if:
    ◦ Issue is minor
    ◦ No data corruption
    ◦ Fix is quick and isolated
🔹 Step 4: Verify System Health
After rollback:
• Confirm:
    ◦ App is stable
    ◦ Error rates return to normal
    ◦ Latency and traffic are healthy
• Keep monitoring for at least 10–30 minutes
🔹 Step 5: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
Once stable:
• Review:
    ◦ CI/CD logs
    ◦ Deployment diffs
    ◦ Config changes
    ◦ Infra vs app failures
• Identify:
    ◦ Why it failed halfway
    ◦ Why it wasn’t caught earlier
🔹 Step 6: Prevent It from Happening Again
Examples:
• Add:
    ◦ Pre-deployment checks
    ◦ Smoke tests
    ◦ Canary or blue-green deployments
• Improve:
    ◦ Rollback automation
    ◦ Alerting during deploys
    ◦ Feature flags for risky changes
2. A build works locally but fails in the CI pipeline. How do you debug it?
🔹 Step 1: Read the CI Error Carefully (Don’t Guess)
• Look at:
    ◦ Exact error message
    ◦ Which stage failed (build / test / package)
• Compare:
    ◦ Local success logs vs CI failure logsMany candidates jump to conclusions — good engineers read first.
🔹 Step 2: Compare Local vs CI Environments
Most “works locally” issues come from environment mismatch.
Check:
• OS (Linux CI vs macOS/Windows local)
• Language/runtime versions (Java, Node, Python, Go)
• Package manager versions
• Environment variables
💡 Fix: Pin versions using:
• .nvmrc, .python-version
• Docker
• Version managers
🔹 Step 3: Dependency Issues
Common problems:
• Missing dependencies in CI
• package-lock.json / poetry.lock / go.sum not committed
• Cached dependencies causing conflicts
Actions:
• Clear CI cache
• Reinstall dependencies from scratch
• Run:

npm ci
pip install -r requirements.txt

🔹 Step 4: Environment Variables & Secrets
• Local machine has env vars that CI doesn’t
• Secrets missing or misconfigured in CI
Check:
• CI secret manager (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
• Variable names and scopes
• Masked secrets vs plaintext values
🔹 Step 5: File Paths & Permissions
CI runs in a clean filesystem.
Common failures:
• Case-sensitive paths (Config.yaml vs config.yaml)
• Files not committed to repo
• Permission issues (chmod +x missing)
🔹 Step 6: Network / External Services
CI environment may:
• Block outbound traffic
• Not have access to:
    ◦ Databases
    ◦ Private repos
    ◦ Internal APIs
Fixes:
• Mock external services
• Use test containers
• Whitelist CI IPs if needed
🔹 Step 7: Reproduce CI Locally
Best debugging move 🚀
• Run CI steps locally:

docker run <ci-image>

• Or:

act   # GitHub Actions

If it fails locally → easier to debug.
🔹 Step 8: Add Debugging Output (Temporarily)
• Print:
    ◦ Environment variables
    ◦ Versions
    ◦ Working directory
• Enable verbose logging:

set -x

3. How would you design a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application?
🔹 High-Level Goals
For a microservices CI/CD pipeline, the goals are:
• Independent deployments per service
• Fast feedback (fail early)
• Safe releases (no downtime)
• Easy rollback
• Consistent environments
🔹 High-Level Architecture

Git → CI → Artifact Registry → CD → Kubernetes / ECS → Monitoring

Each microservice has its own pipeline, but follows a standard template.
🔹 Step 1: Source Control Strategy
• One repo per microservice (preferred) or mono-repo with paths
• Git branching:
    ◦ main → production
    ◦ feature/* → feature branches
• Every commit triggers CI automatically
🔹 Step 2: Continuous Integration (CI)
CI Stages (per microservice)
1. Code Checkout
2. Static Checks
    ◦ Linting
    ◦ Formatting
    ◦ Security scanning (SAST)
3. Unit Tests
4. Build Artifact
    ◦ Docker image
    ◦ Tag with commit-sha + version
5. Push to Registry
    ◦ ECR / Docker Hub / Artifact Registry
💡 Fail fast — don’t build if tests fail.
🔹 Step 3: Artifact Management
• Store immutable artifacts:
    ◦ Docker images
    ◦ Helm charts
• Never rebuild the same artifact in CD“Build once, deploy many times”
🔹 Step 4: Continuous Deployment (CD)
Deployment Flow
1. Deploy to Dev
2. Automated integration tests
3. Deploy to Staging
4. Manual approval (optional)
5. Deploy to Production
Deployment Strategies
• Blue-Green for critical services
• Canary for high-traffic APIs
• Rolling updates for low-risk services
🔹 Step 5: Configuration & Secrets
• Config:
    ◦ ConfigMaps / Parameter Store
• Secrets:
    ◦ Secrets Manager / Vault / Kubernetes Secrets
• Environment-specific configs, same image
🔹 Step 6: Infrastructure as Code
• Provision infra using:
    ◦ Terraform / CloudFormation
• Kubernetes:
    ◦ Helm or Kustomize
• Version-controlled infrastructure
🔹 Step 7: Observability & Feedback
• Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana / CloudWatch
• Logging: ELK / CloudWatch Logs
• Tracing: X-Ray / Jaeger
• Alerts tied to deployments
🔹 Step 8: Rollback Strategy
• Rollback by:
    ◦ Reverting Helm release
    ◦ Switching traffic back (blue-green)
    ◦ Redeploying previous image tag
Rollback must be:
• Fast
• Automated
• Safe
🔹 Security Built-In (Shift Left)
• Dependency scanning
• Image scanning
• Secrets scanning
• Least-privilege IAM roles
4. Your pipeline is too slow and blocking releases. How do you optimize it?
🔹 Step 1: Find Where Time Is Actually Spent
First rule: don’t optimize blindly.
• Measure:
    ◦ Build time
    ◦ Test time
    ◦ Image build & push
    ◦ Deployment time
• Use pipeline timing metrics or logs“I start by identifying the slowest stages before making changes.”
🔹 Step 2: Fail Fast (Shift Left)
• Run linting & unit tests first
• Stop the pipeline early if something fails
• Don’t build Docker images if tests fail
💡 Saves time and money.
🔹 Step 3: Parallelize Aggressively
• Run:
    ◦ Unit tests in parallel
    ◦ Integration tests in parallel
    ◦ Independent microservice pipelines independently
Examples:
• Test sharding
• Matrix buildsSerial pipelines are the biggest CI killer.
🔹 Step 4: Use Caching Correctly (But Carefully)
Cache:
• Dependencies (node_modules, Maven, pip)
• Docker layers
• Build artifacts
Avoid:
• Over-caching → flaky builds
• Cache invalidation bugs
🔹 Step 5: Optimize Docker Builds
• Use multi-stage Docker builds
• Minimize layers
• Use smaller base images (Alpine, distroless)
• Reorder Dockerfile:
    ◦ Copy dependency files first
    ◦ Install deps once
🔹 Step 6: Reduce Test Scope Smartly
• Run:
    ◦ Full test suite on main
    ◦ Targeted tests on feature branches
• Use:
    ◦ Contract tests instead of heavy E2E tests
    ◦ Nightly full regression tests
🔹 Step 7: Optimize Deployment Strategy
• Use:
    ◦ Rolling updates
    ◦ Canary instead of full redeploys
• Avoid redeploying unchanged services
• Use immutable artifacts
🔹 Step 8: Scale CI Infrastructure
• Increase:
    ◦ CI runners
    ◦ CPU / memory for build agents
• Use autoscaling runnersA slow pipeline is often an underpowered pipeline.
🔹 Step 9: Introduce Async & Decoupling
• Make non-critical checks async:
    ◦ Security scans
    ◦ Performance tests
• Don’t block releases unnecessarily

5. Traffic suddenly spikes 10×. Your app becomes slow. What steps do you take?
🔴 Phase 1: Stabilize the System (First 5–10 Minutes)
1️⃣ Confirm the Spike Is Real
• Check:
    ◦ Load balancer request count
    ◦ Traffic sources (organic vs bots)
• Validate it’s not a monitoring glitchDon’t fight ghosts.
2️⃣ Protect the User Experience
• Enable / tighten rate limiting
• Turn on:
    ◦ API Gateway throttling
    ◦ WAF rules (bot / abuse protection)
• Return graceful degradation:
    ◦ Feature flags off
    ◦ Disable non-critical functionality
⚡ Phase 2: Scale Fast (Next 10–20 Minutes)
3️⃣ Scale the App Layer
• Trigger or increase:
    ◦ Auto Scaling Groups
    ◦ Kubernetes HPA
    ◦ ECS service desired count
• Scale horizontally firstVertical scaling is slower and riskier during incidents.
4️⃣ Check the Load Balancer
• Ensure:
    ◦ Healthy targets
    ◦ No connection saturation
• Enable connection draining if needed
🧠 Phase 3: Identify Bottlenecks
5️⃣ Identify the Limiting Resource
Check dashboards:
• CPU / memory

• Watch for cascading failures
🔟 Communicate Clearly
• Update:
    ◦ Incident channel
    ◦ Stakeholders
• Set expectationsSilence causes more damage than outages.
🧪 Phase 6: After the Incident
11️⃣ Post-Incident Review
• Root cause
• Why scaling wasn’t fast enough
• What broke first
12️⃣ Prevent Recurrence
• Load testing
• Autoscaling tuning
• Capacity planning
• Better caching strategy
6. One Availability Zone goes down. How do you design for high availability?
🔹 1. Multi-AZ Architecture (Baseline)
Compute
• Run workloads across multiple Availability Zones
• Use:
    ◦ Auto Scaling Groups spanning ≥2 AZs
    ◦ ECS / EKS with multi-AZ scheduling
Load Balancing
• Use ALB / NLB across AZs
• Health checks automatically route traffic away from failed AZs
🔹 2. Stateless Application Design
• Keep app instances stateless
• Store state in:
    ◦ RDS / DynamoDB
    ◦ S3
    ◦ ElastiCache (with replication)Stateless apps recover instantly when instances are replaced.
🔹 3. Highly Available Data Layer
Databases
• RDS / Aurora Multi-AZ
    ◦ Automatic failover
• DynamoDB
    ◦ Multi-AZ by default
Caching
• ElastiCache with replication groups
• Primary + replicas across AZs
🔹 4. Storage Resilience
• S3 → multi-AZ by default
• EBS
    ◦ Use snapshots
    ◦ Attach only within AZ, but recover quickly
• EFS
    ◦ Multi-AZ file system
🔹 5. Health Checks & Auto Recovery
• Load balancer health checks
• Auto Scaling replaces unhealthy instances
• Kubernetes:
    ◦ Liveness & readiness probes
    ◦ Pod rescheduling to healthy AZs
🔹 6. Traffic & DNS Strategy
• Route 53 health checks
• Optional:
    ◦ Failover routing
    ◦ Weighted routing (for multi-region)
🔹 7. Deployment Strategy Matters
• Rolling, Blue-Green, or Canary
• Never deploy all AZs at once
• Always keep at least one AZ serving traffic
🔹 8. Test AZ Failures (Very Important)
• Simulate AZ failures:
    ◦ Disable subnets
    ◦ Kill nodes
• Validate:
    ◦ Traffic shifts
    ◦ Recovery time (RTO)
    ◦ Data integrity (RPO)HA you don’t test is just hope.
7. You need to reduce cloud costs without affecting performance. What do you do?
🧠 Core PrincipleReduce waste first. Optimize later. Never degrade performance.
🔹 Step 1: Get Visibility (You Can’t Fix What You Can’t See)
• Use:
    ◦ AWS Cost Explorer
    ◦ Cost & Usage Reports (CUR)
    ◦ Per-service and per-team tagging
• Identify:
    ◦ Top 5 cost drivers
    ◦ Underutilized resources
🔹 Step 2: Eliminate Obvious Waste (Fast Wins)
Compute
• Stop or downsize:
    ◦ Idle EC2 instances
    ◦ Unused ASGs
• Right-size instances using:
    ◦ CPU / memory metrics
• Remove:
    ◦ Unattached EBS volumes
    ◦ Old snapshots
🔹 Step 3: Optimize Scaling (Biggest Impact)
• Use Auto Scaling aggressively
• Scale based on:
    ◦ Request count
    ◦ Queue depth
    ◦ Latency (not just CPU)
• Reduce baseline capacity off-peakPaying for idle capacity is the #1 cost leak.
🔹 Step 4: Use the Right Pricing Models
• Reserved Instances / Savings Plans for steady workloads
• Spot Instances for:
    ◦ Batch jobs
    ◦ CI runners
    ◦ Non-critical services
• Keep critical workloads on On-Demand
🔹 Step 5: Improve Performance to Reduce Cost
Counterintuitive but true 👇
• Faster apps = fewer resources
Actions:
• Add caching (Redis, CloudFront)
• Optimize DB queries
• Reduce chatty APIs
🔹 Step 6: Storage Optimization
• Move infrequently accessed data to:
    ◦ S3 IA / Glacier
• Enable:
    ◦ S3 lifecycle policies
    ◦ Log retention policies
• Compress logs
🔹 Step 7: Network & Data Transfer Costs
• Use:
    ◦ VPC endpoints (avoid NAT data charges)
    ◦ CloudFront to reduce egress
• Keep traffic inside the same region/AZ
🔹 Step 8: CI/CD & Dev/Test Cost Control
• Auto-shutdown non-prod environments
• Use smaller instances for test workloads
• Limit parallel CI runners
🔹 Step 9: Guardrails & Automation
• Budgets + alerts
• Policy-as-code:
    ◦ Block oversized instances
    ◦ Enforce tagging
• Regular cost reviews (FinOps culture)
🐳 Containers & Kubernetes
8. A Kubernetes pod keeps restarting. How do you troubleshoot it?
🔹 Step 1: Confirm Why the Pod Is Restarting

kubectl get pod <pod-name>

Check:
• STATUS → CrashLoopBackOff, Error, OOMKilled
Then:

kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

Look at:
• Last State
• Exit codes
• Events (often the biggest clue)
🔹 Step 2: Check Container Logs

kubectl logs <pod-name>

If it already restarted:

kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous

Look for:
• App crashes
• Stack traces
• Config or env variable errors
🔹 Step 3: Identify Common Root Causes
1️⃣ Application Crash
• Unhandled exception
• Misconfigured startup command
• Missing config or secrets
➡️ Fix app config or code.
2️⃣ Liveness / Readiness Probe Failures
• Probe too aggressive
• App needs more startup time
Check:

livenessProbe:
readinessProbe:

Fix:
• Increase initialDelaySeconds
• Adjust timeoutSeconds / failureThreshold
3️⃣ OOMKilled (Out of Memory)
• Pod exceeds memory limits
Check:

kubectl describe pod

Fix:
• Increase memory limits
• Optimize memory usage
• Add HPA if needed
4️⃣ Image Pull Issues
• Wrong image tag
• Registry auth problems
Check events:

ImagePullBackOff

Fix:
• Correct image
• Fix imagePullSecrets
5️⃣ Dependency Failures
• DB / API not reachable
• App exits when dependency is down
Fix:
• Add retries
• Use readiness probes instead of crashing
• Implement graceful startup logic
🔹 Step 4: Validate Configuration
• ConfigMaps mounted?
• Secrets present?
• Correct env vars?

kubectl describe pod

🔹 Step 5: Check Node & Resource Pressure
• Node out of memory or disk
• Pod evicted

kubectl describe node <node-name>

🔹 Step 6: Debug Interactively (If Needed)

kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh

Check:
• Files
• Env vars
• Network access
🔹 Step 7: Fix & Roll Forward
• Apply fix
• Restart deployment:

kubectl rollout restart deployment <name>

Monitor:
• Pod stability
• Restart count
• Error rate
9. One microservice is consuming excessive CPU in the cluster. What’s your approach?
🔹 Phase 1: Confirm & Scope the Problem
1️⃣ Identify the Offending Service
• Check metrics:
    ◦ Prometheus / Grafana
    ◦ kubectl top pods
• Verify:
    ◦ Is CPU high for one pod or all replicas?
    ◦ Is it sustained or spiky?Always confirm before acting.
🔹 Phase 2: Contain the Impact
2️⃣ Protect the Cluster
• Apply or verify:
    ◦ CPU requests and limits
    ◦ Pod disruption budgets
• Prevent noisy neighbor problemsOne bad service should never starve the cluster.
🔹 Phase 3: Identify the Root Cause
3️⃣ Check Traffic Patterns
• Has request volume increased?
• Any new consumers?
• Is it being hammered by retries or bots?
4️⃣ Analyze Application Behavior
• Check:
    ◦ Logs for tight loops
    ◦ Inefficient algorithms
    ◦ Serialization or parsing hot paths
• Profile if possible (pprof, JVM tools)
5️⃣ Look for Dependency Issues
• Slow downstream service causing retries
• Missing timeouts or circuit breakersHigh CPU is often symptom, not cause.
🔹 Phase 4: Fix or Mitigate
6️⃣ Short-Term Mitigation
• Scale horizontally (HPA)
• Rate-limit incoming requests
• Enable caching
• Reduce log verbosity
7️⃣ Long-Term Fix
• Optimize code paths
• Improve caching
• Add async processing
• Tune CPU requests/limits
• Add autoscaling based on:
    ◦ CPU
    ◦ RPS
    ◦ Latency
🔹 Phase 5: Prevent Recurrence
8️⃣ Improve Observability
• Service-level dashboards
• CPU per request metrics
• Alerts on abnormal CPU growth
9️⃣ Add Guardrails
• Resource quotas
• Admission controllers
• Cost and usage alerts
10. How would you deploy a zero-downtime update in Kubernetes?
🧠 Core PrincipleNever take down all replicas at once, and never send traffic to an unready pod.
🔹 Step 1: Use a Deployment (Not Naked Pods)
• Deploy apps using Deployment or StatefulSet
• Ensure:
    ◦ At least 2 replicas
    ◦ Pod is stateless
🔹 Step 2: Configure Rolling Update Strategy

strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 0
    maxSurge: 1

• maxUnavailable: 0 → no downtime
• maxSurge: 1 → bring up new pod before killing old one
🔹 Step 3: Proper Readiness Probes (Critical)

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10

• Traffic is sent only when the pod is ready
• Unready pods never receive trafficReadiness probes are the backbone of zero downtime.
🔹 Step 4: Graceful Shutdown Handling
• Handle SIGTERM properly
• Add:

terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30

• Let:
    ◦ In-flight requests finish
    ◦ Load balancer drain connections
🔹 Step 5: Use Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)

minAvailable: 1

• Prevents voluntary disruptions from killing all pods
• Protects during node drains or cluster upgrades
🔹 Step 6: Validate During Rollout

kubectl rollout status deployment <name>

Monitor:
• Error rates
• Latency
• Pod restarts
🔹 Step 7: Rollback If Needed

kubectl rollout undo deployment <name>

Rollback should be:
• Fast
• Automatic
• Safe
🔐 Security & Compliance
11. Secrets are accidentally committed to Git. What immediate and long-term steps do you take?
🚨 Immediate Actions (First Minutes)
1️⃣ Assume the Secret Is Compromised
• Treat it as already leaked

9️⃣ Educate & Document
• Update:
    ◦ Secure coding guidelines
    ◦ Incident playbooks
• Run a blameless postmortem
12. How do you secure a CI/CD pipeline?
🧠 Core PrincipleThe CI/CD pipeline is production’s front door — compromise it and everything downstream is compromised.
🔹 1. Secure Source Control
• Protect branches:
    ◦ Require PR reviews
    ◦ Enforce status checks
• Restrict who can:
    ◦ Push to main
    ◦ Modify pipeline configs
• Enable:
    ◦ Signed commits
    ◦ MFA for all users
🔹 2. Secrets Management (Critical)
• Never hardcode secrets
• Store secrets in:
    ◦ AWS Secrets Manager / Vault
    ◦ CI secret stores
• Use:
    ◦ Short-lived credentials
    ◦ IAM roles / OIDC (no static keys)
• Mask secrets in logs
🔹 3. Secure the CI Runners
• Use:
    ◦ Ephemeral runners (preferred)
    ◦ Isolated build environments
• Restrict:
    ◦ Network access
    ◦ Privileged containers
• Patch runners regularly
🔹 4. Dependency & Code Security (Shift Left)
• SAST (static analysis)
• Dependency scanning (CVEs)
• Secrets scanning
• Fail builds on high-severity issues
🔹 5. Secure Build Artifacts
• Build once, deploy many times
• Sign artifacts:
    ◦ Container image signing (cosign)
• Store in private registries
• Prevent artifact overwrites
🔹 6. Deployment Security
• Use:
    ◦ Least-privilege service accounts
    ◦ Environment-specific roles
• Require:
    ◦ Manual approvals for prod
• Separate:
    ◦ Build vs deploy permissions
🔹 7. Infrastructure as Code Security
• Scan IaC:
    ◦ Terraform / CloudFormation checks
• Enforce policies:
    ◦ OPA / Sentinel
• Prevent insecure infra from being deployed
🔹 8. Observability & Auditing
• Log:
    ◦ Pipeline executions
    ◦ Access changes
• Enable:
    ◦ CloudTrail / audit logs
• Monitor:
    ◦ Unusual pipeline behavior
🔹 9. Protect the Supply Chain
• Pin dependencies
• Verify checksums
• Use trusted base images
• Prevent dependency confusion attacks.
13. A vulnerability is found in a production container image. What do you do?
🔹 Step 1: Assess the Risk Immediately
• Check:
    ◦ Severity of the vulnerability (CVSS score, exploitability)
    ◦ Whether it affects your application functionality
• Identify:
    ◦ Which environments and containers are affected
    ◦ Whether the container is exposed to the publicAssume the worst-case scenario until confirmed otherwise.
🔹 Step 2: Mitigate Exposure Quickly
• If critical:
    ◦ Remove the vulnerable container from public access or routing
    ◦ Disable affected services temporarily if needed
• For less critical:
    ◦ Monitor closely
    ◦ Apply temporary firewall, WAF, or network isolation
🔹 Step 3: Patch & Rebuild
• Pull the latest base image with the security fix
• Rebuild the container from scratch
• Run all CI/CD tests to ensure the patch does not break functionality
• Push the new image to your private registry
🔹 Step 4: Redeploy Safely
• Use zero-downtime deployment strategies:
    ◦ Rolling update
    ◦ Blue-Green
    ◦ Canary
• Ensure:
    ◦ Health checks pass
    ◦ Monitoring dashboards show stable performance
🔹 Step 5: Remove Vulnerable Images
• Delete the old image from:
    ◦ Registries
    ◦ Build caches
• Prevent accidental redeployments
🔹 Step 6: Verify & Monitor
• Monitor:
    ◦ Error rates
    ◦ Security alerts
    ◦ Traffic anomalies
• Run vulnerability scanning on deployed images to confirm the fix
🔹 Step 7: Implement Long-Term Prevention
• Enable image scanning in CI/CD (Snyk, Trivy, Clair, Anchore)
• Pin base images to known versions
• Automate rebuilds on base image updates
• Adopt a supply chain security approach (SLSA / SBOM)
📊 Monitoring, Logging & Incident Response
14. Users report intermittent latency, but monitoring shows everything “green.” What next?
🔹 Step 1: Confirm the Issue
• Collect as much detail from users as possible:
    ◦ Time of latency spikes
    ◦ Which endpoints / services are affected
    ◦ Geography / device patterns
• Try to reproduce the latency yourselfSometimes users’ perception differs from system dashboards.
🔹 Step 2: Check Detailed Metrics
• “Green” in high-level dashboards may hide spikes. Check:
    ◦ Percentiles (p95/p99), not just averages
    ◦ Latency by endpoint / service / pod / node
    ◦ Traffic volume / request bursts
    ◦ Database query times and queue lengthsHigh tail latency often hides in averages.
🔹 Step 3: Inspect Logs & Traces
• Enable distributed tracing (X-Ray, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)
• Look for:
    ◦ Slow requests
    ◦ Timeouts waiting on dependencies
    ◦ Retries or failed connections
• Check application logs for errors or warnings not captured in metrics
🔹 Step 4: Check External Dependencies
• DB, cache, third-party APIs, or message queues
• Look for intermittent slow queries or throttling
• Sometimes the app itself is fine; latency is upstream
🔹 Step 5: Network & Infrastructure
• Inspect:
    ◦ VPC / subnet / firewall issues
    ◦ Load balancer spikes / connection limits
    ◦ DNS resolution latency
    ◦ Pod-to-pod network latency in KubernetesNetwork blips often cause intermittent issues while metrics look green on average.
🔹 Step 6: Resource Contention
• Check node-level CPU/memory spikes or throttling
• Check JVM / GC pauses if running Java apps
• Container CPU/memory limits causing throttling
🔹 Step 7: Deploy Instrumentation (If Needed)
• Add more granular metrics:
    ◦ Endpoint-level timing
    ◦ DB query duration histograms
    ◦ Request queue depth
• This helps capture tail latency spikes
🔹 Step 8: Communicate & Mitigate
• Inform users / stakeholders about investigation
• If possible, implement temporary mitigation:
    ◦ Enable caching
    ◦ Reduce non-critical features
    ◦ Retry/backoff optimization

• Respond immediately to the alert (PagerDuty / Opsgenie / Slack)
• Identify:
    ◦ Which service is down
    ◦ Impact scope (number of users, criticality)
• Communicate:“Incident acknowledged — investigating.”
2️⃣ Mitigate Customer Impact
• Route traffic away if possible:
    ◦ Use load balancer health checks
    ◦ Disable affected endpoints
• Enable fallbacks or feature flags
• Goal: minimize user impact while investigation proceeds
🧪 Phase 2: Investigate the Root Cause (5–20 minutes)
3️⃣ Check System & Service Health
• kubectl get pods / kubectl describe for K8s
• Check auto-scaling, node availability
• Verify load balancers, DNS, network connectivity
4️⃣ Examine Logs & Metrics
• CloudWatch / Prometheus / Grafana dashboards
• Application logs for errors
• Metrics for CPU, memory, disk, request latency, queue depth
5️⃣ Identify Recent Changes
• Deployment? Config change? Infra update?
• Rollback candidate if new release caused failure
⚡ Phase 3: Fix or Mitigate (20–60 minutes)
6️⃣ Quick Mitigation
• Redeploy last stable version
• Restart failing pods / services
• Remove misbehaving nodes or containers
• Activate backup / failover systems if available
7️⃣ Confirm Recovery
• Ensure the service is healthy (kubectl rollout status, metrics normalized)
• Verify users can access functionality
📝 Phase 4: Post-Incident Actions
8️⃣ Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
• Determine underlying cause:
    ◦ Bug, configuration error, infrastructure failure, external dependency
• Document timeline and decisions
• Include metrics and logs for reference
9️⃣ Prevent Recurrence
• Adjust monitoring & alerts (p95 latency, error spikes)
• Fix deployment pipeline or IaC issues
• Update runbooks
16. How do you decide what metrics to monitor for a new service?
🧠 Core PrincipleMonitor what matters to reliability, performance, and business outcomes.
🔹 Step 1: Understand the Service
• Ask:
    ◦ What does the service do? (business context)
    ◦ What are critical paths / endpoints?
    ◦ Which dependencies matter (DB, cache, external APIs)?Example: A payment service → success rate, latency, transaction volume.
🔹 Step 2: Monitor Infrastructure Health
• CPU / memory / disk / network of nodes or containers
• Pod / instance status (Kubernetes pod restarts, node health)
• Autoscaling metrics (desired vs actual replicas)Ensures the service has enough resources.
🔹 Step 3: Monitor Application Health
• Request rate / throughput
• Latency (p50, p95, p99)
• Error rates (4xx / 5xx, exceptions, failed jobs)
• Queue depth (for async processing)Captures internal performance and reliability.
🔹 Step 4: Monitor External Dependencies
• Database:
    ◦ Connection pool usage, query latency, replication lag
• Caches:
    ◦ Hit ratio, eviction rate
• External APIs:
    ◦ Success rate, latency, rate limitsSlow dependencies often cause service degradation.
🔹 Step 5: Monitor Business Metrics (Optional but Valuable)
• Number of transactions per minute
• Orders processed
• Signups / logins / feature usageDetect issues invisible in system metrics.
🔹 Step 6: Define Alerts Carefully
• Avoid alert fatigue
• Alert thresholds for:
    ◦ High error rate
    ◦ Latency spikes
    ◦ Resource exhaustion
• Use multi-metric correlation for smarter alerts
🔹 Step 7: Review and Iterate
• After initial deployment:
    ◦ Add/remove metrics based on real-world behavior
    ◦ Monitor tail latency, rare errors, saturation points
• Continuous improvement → dashboards evolve with service
📦 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
17. A Terraform apply fails in production. What’s your rollback plan?
🧠 Core PrincipleAlways assume Terraform can fail. Have a rollback plan and minimize blast radius.
🔹 Step 1: Pause & Assess
• Do not panic — stop further changes.
• Check:
    ◦ Error message (terraform apply output)
    ◦ Which resources failed / partially applied
    ◦ State file status (local or remote backend)Understanding what went wrong before acting is critical.
🔹 Step 2: Identify the Impacted Resources
• Use:

terraform plan
terraform state list

• Determine:
    ◦ Resources fully created
    ◦ Resources partially modified
    ◦ Dependencies that could breakPartial applies are the biggest risk in production.
🔹 Step 3: Rollback Options
Option A: Terraform Rollback
• Terraform doesn’t have a native “undo”, but you can:
    1. Restore previous state file from remote backend (S3 / Terraform Cloud)
    2. Run:

terraform apply

→ This will revert infrastructure to the last known good state
Option B: Manual Rollback
• For critical resources (databases, networking):
    ◦ Revert configuration manually
    ◦ Use snapshots/backups if needed
    ◦ Apply changes incrementally
Option C: Blue-Green / Immutable Infrastructure
• If using:
    ◦ EC2 / ECS / Kubernetes / Terraform modules
• Switch traffic back to previous environment
• Destroy failed resources after verification
🔹 Step 4: Verify Recovery
• Validate:
    ◦ Services are up and healthy
    ◦ Configurations match desired state
    ◦ No downtime for users (if applicable)
🔹 Step 5: Post-Incident
• Analyze:
    ◦ Why terraform apply failed (syntax, permissions, resource limits, API errors)
    ◦ Why rollback was needed
• Prevent recurrence:
    ◦ Use Terraform plan + approval in production
    ◦ Enable state versioning / locking
    ◦ Use smoke tests before applying critical changes
18. Multiple teams modify the same infrastructure. How do you prevent conflicts?
🧠 Core PrincipleInfrastructure should be versioned, collaborative, and conflict-free — like code.
🔹 Step 1: Use Remote State with Locking
• Store state in remote backends:
    ◦ S3 + DynamoDB (locking)
    ◦ Terraform Cloud / Enterprise
• Enable state locking to prevent multiple applies at the same timePrevents concurrent modifications that break the state.
🔹 Step 2: Modularize Infrastructure
• Split infra into independent modules:
    ◦ Networking, DB, compute, monitoring
• Assign ownership per module to different teams
• Avoid multiple teams modifying the same module simultaneouslySmaller modules = smaller blast radius.
🔹 Step 3: Version Control & Branching
• All changes go through Git:
    ◦ Feature branches
    ◦ Pull requests / merge requests
• Require:
    ◦ Code review
    ◦ Terraform plan review before merge
• CI validates plan against remote stateCode + plan review catches conflicts before apply.
🔹 Step 4: Apply Approval Workflows
• Use manual approvals for production:
    ◦ Terraform Cloud / Enterprise workspaces
    ◦ GitHub Actions + protected branches
• Prevent accidental direct terraform apply
🔹 Step 5: Use Workspaces or Environments
• Separate workspaces for:
    ◦ Dev / QA / Staging / Prod
• Teams can test changes without affecting others
🔹 Step 6: Naming Conventions & Scoping
• Consistent resource naming
• Avoid hardcoded values
• Scope resources by team or project to prevent accidental overlap
🔹 Step 7: Monitor & Audit Changes
• Enable logging and audit trails:
    ◦ Who applied what and when
    ◦ State changes over time
• Helps quickly resolve conflicts if they occur
🤝 Collaboration & Process
19. Developers want faster releases, ops wants stability. How do you balance both?
🧠 Core PrincipleBalance speed and stability by automating safe releases and building confidence in the system.
🔹 Step 1: Implement CI/CD Pipelines
• Developers push code frequently
• Pipelines automatically:
    ◦ Build
    ◦ Run unit tests
    ◦ Run integration tests
• Artifacts are immutable and ready for deploymentFast feedback catches issues before reaching production.
🔹 Step 2: Use Progressive Deployment Strategies
• Canary deployments: release to a small subset of users first
• Blue-Green deployments: switch traffic only when the new version is ready
• Feature flags: release features safely without full rolloutReduces risk while allowing faster releases.
🔹 Step 3: Automate Testing and Validation
• Automated tests:
    ◦ Unit, integration, contract, performance
• Pre-prod environments:
    ◦ Mirror production for realistic testing
• Static analysis / security scanning
• Ensures stability doesn’t block speed
🔹 Step 4: Monitor & Rollback Quickly
• Observability in production:
    ◦ Prometheus/Grafana metrics
    ◦ Logs / distributed tracing
• Set up alerts and automated rollback triggers
• Confidence that if something goes wrong, it can be reverted immediately
🔹 Step 5: Collaboration & Culture
• Shared metrics for both teams:
    ◦ Deployment frequency
    ◦ Change failure rate
    ◦ Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
• Ops provides guardrails; developers innovate within safe boundariesTransparency and feedback loops align goals.
🔹 Step 6: Small, Incremental Changes
• Smaller, frequent releases are safer than large, infrequent ones
• Easier to debug, easier to rollback
• Keeps velocity high without compromising stability
20. How do you introduce DevOps practices in a legacy organization?
🧠 Core PrincipleDevOps is as much cultural as it is technical — you can’t just install tools.
🔹 Step 1: Assess the Current State
• Understand:
    ◦ How teams build, test, deploy software
    ◦ Pain points in development, operations, and QA
    ◦ Existing tooling and workflows
• Identify low-hanging fruit for early winsBaseline knowledge helps prioritize initiatives and get buy-in.
🔹 Step 2: Start with Culture & Collaboration
• Break down silos:
    ◦ Devs, Ops, QA working together
• Introduce shared responsibility for:
    ◦ Deployment success
    ◦ Application reliability
• Encourage blameless postmortemsCulture is the hardest but most important part.
🔹 Step 3: Automate the Basics
• Implement CI pipelines first:
    ◦ Version control, automated builds, unit tests
• Gradually add:
    ◦ Integration tests
    ◦ Artifact repositories
    ◦ Automated deployments to stagingEarly automation builds confidence and reduces friction.
🔹 Step 4: Introduce Incremental Deployment Practices
• Start small:
    ◦ Feature flags
    ◦ Canary or blue-green deployments
• Target non-critical services first
• Measure impact and reliability before scaling to production
🔹 Step 5: Monitoring & Observability
• Implement metrics, logging, and alerts for early wins:
    ◦ Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, CloudWatch, etc.
• Teams can see the impact of changes and identify bottlenecksVisibility drives trust in DevOps processes.
🔹 Step 6: Measure Success & Iterate
• Track KPIs:
    ◦ Deployment frequency
    ◦ Change failure rate
    ◦ MTTR (mean time to recovery)
• Celebrate wins publicly
• Iterate on pipelines, automation, and processes
🔹 Step 7: Expand Gradually
• After early wins:
    ◦ Introduce Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
    ◦ Implement secrets management
    ◦ Apply security scanning / DevSecOps practicesDon’t try to change everything at once — DevOps is evolutionary, not revolutionary.
